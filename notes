Displays:
Tree (organized by dependencies)
Topologically sorted (client-side0
List of all by category (parent node) w/prioritization & right side showing dep tree

"Node":
Permissions (read, write, "do task", groups)
Types (executable on server as special)

Tree order:
Node has list of pointers to Nodes that depend on it.
Thus, empty "category" Nodes can have an easily maintained list of related "dependencies".
Better server maintenance for when Node is completed.
